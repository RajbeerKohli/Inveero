          <h1>A Journey to Financial Independence Through ETF Investments 🌟</h1>
          <p>ETFs are a versatile tool for both beginners and experienced investors. They offer 
            an easy way to build a diversified portfolio and are suitable for long-term wealth 
            building, hedging, or focusing on specific market opportunities. Their combination of 
            simplicity, flexibility, and cost-efficiency makes them a popular choice in modern 
            investing.</p>

          <h2>Step 1: Know Where You Are - Current Age 📅</h2>
          <p><strong>Your current age determines how much time you have to invest and grow your wealth.</strong>
            <br />
            The earlier you start, the longer your money has to compound and 
            grow. A 25-year-old has a significant advantage over a 45-year-old because of the power 
            of compound interest.
            <br />
            <strong>Starting sooner can mean less stress later in life. 🕒</strong></p>

          <h2>Step 2: Set Your Destination - Retirement Age 🎯</h2>
          <p><strong>The age you want to retire by is your goalpost.</strong>
            <br />
            Your investment horizon (the time between now and retirement) affects 
            your risk tolerance and the types of ETFs you invest in. Longer horizons allow for 
            higher-risk growth-focused investments, while shorter horizons may require a more 
            conservative approach. 📈📉
            <br />
            <Strong>Choose a retirement age that aligns with your goals and health. 🌱</Strong></p>

          <h2>Step 3: Map Your Contributions - Monthly Savings 💰</h2>
          <p><strong>How much can you invest each month?</strong>
            <br />
            Regular contributions are the backbone of your investment strategy. 
            Small, consistent savings can grow exponentially over time. ETFs allow you to invest in a 
            variety of assets without requiring a large initial sum. 📊
            <br />
            <Strong>Prioritize regular savings to build momentum. 🚀</Strong></p>

          <!-- Contribution Increments - Explanation -->
          <h2>Step 4: Adjust for Growth - Contribution Increments 📈</h2>
          <p><strong>Will you increase your contributions annually?</strong>
            <br />
            Incremental increases, either by a percentage (e.g., 5%) or a fixed 
            amount (e.g., $100), help your investments keep pace with inflation and income growth. A 
            small annual increase can result in a significantly larger portfolio over time. 🔄
            <br />
            <strong>Plan for contribution growth to maximize long-term potential. 💪</strong></p>

          <p><strong>How much money will you need to live comfortably?</strong>
            <br />
            Understanding your required income helps you determine your target 
            portfolio size. For instance, if you need $50,000 annually, your portfolio might need to be 
            25x that amount, or $1.25 million (assuming a 4% withdrawal rate). 💡
            <br />
            <Strong>Define your lifestyle needs and plan accordingly. 🏡</Strong></p>

          <!-- Expected Return on Investment - Explanation -->
          <h2>Step 6: Forecast Your Journey - Expected Return on Investment (ROI) 📈</h2>
          <p><strong>What return do you expect from your ETFs?</strong>
            <br />
            The ROI affects how quickly your investments grow. Growth-oriented ETFs, 
            such as equity ETFs, often yield higher returns but come with greater risk. Balanced or bond 
            ETFs typically offer lower returns with stability. ⚖️
            <br />
            <strong>Choose ETFs based on your risk appetite and time horizon. 🔍</strong></p>

          <!-- Inflation - Explanation -->

          <p><strong>What is the annual inflation rate in your country?</strong>
            <br />
            Inflation reduces your purchasing power over time. A $1,000 investment today 
            may not buy the same value in 20 years. Your investments must outpace inflation to maintain your 
            standard of living. 💸➡️💸
            <br />
            <strong>Factor inflation into your target returns and desired retirement income. 📉</strong></p>
